	# Flag to control whether or not to output all
	# the debug log. Actually, the output is controlled
	# in two places. Both need to be activated  in order
	# to have the debug output:
	# 1. The log4go XML configuration file. The Debug
	#    output level should be activated.
	# 2. The Debug flag below.
	#
	# The reason to add this flag is for code optimization
	# (i.e. execution speed/memory usage) in Golang as
	# the log4go doesn't support the isDebugEnable method
	# like log4j in Java.
	#
	# Indeed, despite the debug output being  controlled
	# by the XML configuration file of log4go, it won't
	# prevent all the processing power required to prepare
	# these logs since logging requires concatenating
	# strings together just to drop them in the end if
	# debug is not the active output level. So one can
	# surround these log output preparation by a test of
	# the below flag to avoid computing them when not required.
	#
	# Example:
	#
	# if config.GetFEConfig().Common.Debug {
	#    l4g.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("#%v: Value of (x=%v, y=%v, z=%v) lead to err '%s'",thread_id, x, y, z,err.Error()))
	# }
	#
	# In production, this flag should be set to false.

	# can retrieve these values automatically and interact with
